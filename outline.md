# Book Outline: Quantum Topological Field Theory for Beginners

## Target Audience:

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers in physics, mathematics, and computer science who have a basic understanding of quantum mechanics, linear algebra, and calculus. No prior knowledge of advanced topology or field theory is assumed.

## Scope:

This book will cover the foundational concepts of Quantum Topological Field Theory (QTFT), focusing on intuitive explanations and illustrative examples rather than exhaustive mathematical rigor. It will introduce key ideas from topology, quantum mechanics, and field theory as they pertain to QTFT, and explore specific models like Chern-Simons theory. The book will also touch upon the applications of QTFT, particularly in topological quantum computing.
