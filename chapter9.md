## 9.3 Mathematics (Low-Dimensional Topology)

The relationship between [Quantum Topological Field Theory (QTFT)](/BOOK/glossary/quantum_topological_field_theory.md) and mathematics is not merely one of application; it is a symbiotic one, where physics provides intuition and new problems, and mathematics provides the rigorous framework and solutions. This is particularly evident in the field of **low-dimensional topology**, which studies [manifolds](/BOOK/glossary/manifold.md) of dimensions one, two, three, and four.

### The Interplay of Physics and Mathematics

Historically, many profound connections between physics and mathematics have emerged from the study of quantum field theories. QTFTs, by their very nature, are deeply intertwined with topological and geometric concepts. Edward Witten's work on [Chern-Simons theory](/BOOK/glossary/chern_simons_theory.md) and its connection to [knot theory](/BOOK/glossary/knot_theory.md) is a prime example of this synergy, where a physical theory provided a powerful new tool for a purely mathematical problem.

### Knot Theory Revisited

As discussed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 6, [Chern-Simons theory](/BOOK/glossary/chern_simons_theory.md) provides a physical realization of [knot invariants](/BOOK/glossary/knot_theory.md). The expectation values of [Wilson loops](/BOOK/glossary/wilson_loop.md) in [Chern-Simons theory](/BOOK/glossary/chern_simons_theory.md) correspond to various polynomial [invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md) of knots and links, such as the Jones polynomial. This connection has revolutionized [knot theory](/BOOK/glossary/knot_theory.md), providing new methods for calculating these [invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md) and inspiring new mathematical research.

### 3-Manifold Invariants

Beyond knots, [QTFTs](/BOOK/glossary/quantum_topological_field_theory.md) also provide powerful tools for studying the topology of 3-[manifolds](/BOOK/glossary/manifold.md). The partition function of [Chern-Simons theory](/BOOK/glossary/chern_simons_theory.md) on a closed 3-[manifold](/BOOK/glossary/manifold.md) yields [topological invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md) of that [manifold](/BOOK/glossary/manifold.md), such as the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) [invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md). These [invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md) are crucial for classifying and understanding the complex world of 3-[manifolds](/BOOK/glossary/manifold.md), which are notoriously difficult to classify in mathematics.

### Other Topological Invariants

[QTFTs](/BOOK/glossary/quantum_topological_field_theory.md) are also connected to other [topological invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md), such as:

*   **Intersection Numbers**: In some [QTFTs](/BOOK/glossary/quantum_topological_field_theory.md), correlation functions can be related to intersection numbers of cycles in a [manifold](/BOOK/glossary/manifold.md), which are fundamental topological quantities.
*   **[Cohomology](/BOOK/glossary/cohomology.md)**: As briefly mentioned in Chapter 2, [cohomology](/BOOK/glossary/cohomology.md) plays a significant role in understanding the structure of [gauge theories](/BOOK/glossary/gauge_theory.md) and [topological invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md). Many [topological invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md) have a cohomological interpretation.

### Future Directions in Mathematical Physics

The ongoing interplay between [QTFT](/BOOK/glossary/quantum_topological_field_theory.md) and low-dimensional topology continues to be a fertile ground for research. Physicists are using mathematical tools to explore new quantum field theories with topological properties, while mathematicians are drawing inspiration from physics to develop new [topological invariants](/BOOK/glossary/topological_invariants.md) and classification schemes. This cross-pollination of ideas promises to lead to further breakthroughs in both fields, deepening our understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time, and quantum phenomena.
